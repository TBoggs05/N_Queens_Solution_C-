Just a basic one file solution to the N-Queens Problem. Assumes N = 8. Uses a 2D array and Recursive Backtracking in C++.
Currently only finds the first available solution to the board, but hopefully will be changed to find all viable solutions to a given board assuming N within an acceptable range.


To run it simply use command line to compile
c++ main.cpp -o (insert name of output file here)
